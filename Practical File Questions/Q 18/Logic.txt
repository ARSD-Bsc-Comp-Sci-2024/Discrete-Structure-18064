This program to find the number of paths of length n between source and destination entered by user uses logic
that using an adjacency matrix A of the graph, the number of path of length n between I and j can be found by calculating 
A^n, then A^n[i][j] will give the number of paths.

Both the program are not exactly perfect and does not give result for adjacent vertex. 
But they work for majority of combination of vertices.
